# 🌍 kozou.dev

This is the repo for my personal portoflio website available [here](https://kozou.dev)!

## ✨ Tools

This website was created using Nuxt 2 and its built-in framework, Vue. I choose the TailwindCSS framework for the style.

<div align="center" style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; 
flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center; padding:2px; border-color: #1e293b"; border-radius: 5px;>
